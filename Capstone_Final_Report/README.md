# capstone-project
Springboard capstone project - European Soccer Database
Dataset comprises of 25K+ matches, 10K+ players, 11 European countries, club matches data from seasons 2008-2016 and team, match attributes and player data
The goal of the project is to help the client i.e. the european football clubs identify the best players for their teams using player ratings

The data available in the data source was first cleaned and preprocessed using the code in file 'Data_Wrangling_Capstone_Project.ipynb' and the updated new files generated were pushed back into the sqlite database.

The updated database is made available in a zip folder 'database.sqlite.zip'. Please unzip the file in the working directory before running the project code which is available in the file 'Capstone_Final_Report_Soccer_Data.ipynb'

The report for this project is in the file 'capstone_project_final_report_soccer_pdf' and the slide deck is in 'capstone_project_slide.pdf'
